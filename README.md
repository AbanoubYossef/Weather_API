Sure, here's a README for your Django Weather App:

# Django Weather App


## Overview

The Django Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check the weather forecast for cities around the world. It provides real-time weather data and displays it in an easy-to-read format.

## Features

- **Weather Forecast**: Users can enter the name of a city to get the current weather forecast.
- **Detailed Information**: The app provides information such as temperature, humidity, pressure, visibility, and more.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Weather data is retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Database Storage**: Data for each city is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- **City Watchlist**: Users can add multiple cities to their watchlist for quick access to weather updates.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x**: You should have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- **PostgreSQL**: The app uses a PostgreSQL database to store city data.
- **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather data. You can [sign up here](https://openweathermap.org/api) to obtain an API key.
